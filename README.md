This is a Vigenère cipher app created in React. This is inspired by the Shopify internship application asking to decrypt a phrase with a key.

\*\*Instead of searching for the answer, I decided to take this matter into my own hands and make sure I was getting the correct answer by building the decoder myself. This was fun to research about the vigenère cipher and how to implement it with user input on the web app. Also great practice building components in react.
